## Overview:
This Bidding System is a Python-based application designed to manage live auction sessions, track bids, and facilitate post-auction processes like reporting and planning deliveries. It combines a straightforward console interface with file-based data management, making it accessible for both small-scale auction events and individual use. The project aims to simplify the complexities involved in auction management by providing a comprehensive toolkit for session management, data persistence, contact management, and delivery scheduling.

- Data Persistence: Save session data into CSV files for permanent record-keeping and future reference.
- Dynamic Reporting: Generate detailed reports summarizing bidder activity, including total bids and items won, in a .docx format suitable for printing or electronic distribution.
- Contact Management: (Upcoming) Maintain an address book of participants involved in the auction, including sellers and bidders, to streamline communication.
- Delivery Planning: (Upcoming) Plan and track the delivery of auction items to winners, ensuring a seamless post-auction process.
- Results Formatting: (Upcoming) Process and format results into a range of user-defined layouts.
